I am a computing science PhD student at the University of Alberta working with
[Marlos C. Machado](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~machado/)
and
[Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/).
My primary interest is **reinforcement learning**.

My research focuses on the temporal credit-assignment problem and efficient reward-based learning.
I am particularly interested in addressing high-dimensional environments where classical methods become infeasible.
To this end, my algorithms often utilize deep neural networks to process rich sensory data, which present a variety of challenges to long-term credit assignment.

See my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PP2_bZ8AAAAJ) for a list of my publications.
